    "One of our group members came across a Reddit post where a man was pictured flying on an airplane alone and he postulated that this lucky scenario occurred because few people wanted to fly during the pandemic. This made us curious about how airlines are holding up in the pandemic. We found many articles that wrote about airline stocks dropping in the wake of Covid. We want to analyze stock data ourselves to see if they support these claims. We wanted to specifically select our data during the official announcements of the different Coronavirus strains since they would likely be important food for thought for those who contribute in the stock market.\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that the U.S. airline stocks will tank significantly following each major strain announcement. We believe this due to the U.S.'s general attitude toward Coronavirus which encourages social distancing so fewer people will want to be exposed on a plane. We think that the fear each announcement ignites in the general public poses a reasonable assumption that there would be lesser plane patronage, as well as many entertainment places being forced closed so people won't be as inclined to travel. Thus, we believe investors of U.S. airline company stocks would likely try to sell them after the announcements, causing the stocks to plummet."

    "The ideal dataset would be the stock patterns from a large sample of U.S. airline companies at time intervals of a month before and a month after each CDC announcement of the big 3 Covid-19 strains (original, Delta, Omnicron). All necessary data for the airline stocks readily exists on Google as it is public information. We can also grab the dates of the CDC major Covid-19 strain  announcements on the CDC's page. The stock data would need to be wrangled to only include the time periods we care about. \n",
